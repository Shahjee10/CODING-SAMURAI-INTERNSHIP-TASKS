## ⚙️ Steps Performed

### 1. Data Cleaning
- Standardized text values (e.g., converted “M/F” to “Male/Female”).
- Added new column **“Age Bracket”** based on the age range.
- Removed inconsistencies and formatted income field.

### 2. Data Analysis
Created **three PivotTables** to explore:
1. **Average Income per Purchase**
2. **Customer Commute Distance**
3. **Customer Age Bracket**

### 3. Dashboard Creation
Built a dynamic **Excel Dashboard** with:
- PivotCharts linked to the three analyses above.
- **Slicers** for:
  - Region  
  - Marital Status  
  - Gender  
These slicers were connected to all PivotTables for synchronized filtering.

---

## 📊 Key Insights
- Married individuals showed higher average income levels compared to single customers.  
- Most customers with short commute distances (0–1 miles) were non-purchasers.  
- The **Middle Age group** (30–50 years) represented the largest buyer segment.  

---

## 💡 Tools Used
- **Microsoft Excel 2016**
  - PivotTables  
  - PivotCharts  
  - Slicers  
  - Conditional Formatting  

---

## 🧾 Deliverables
- Cleaned Dataset (Excel file)
- PivotTables for analysis
- Interactive Dashboard (Excel)

---

## 🚀 Outcome
This project enhanced my understanding of:
- Data analysis workflow from raw data → insights → visualization  
- Building professional dashboards in Excel  
- Communicating insights effectively using visuals
